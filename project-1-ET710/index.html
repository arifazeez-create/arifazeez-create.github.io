    <p><i>Northern Lights in iceland</i></p>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind,Boreas.From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies</p>

    <p><i>Ice climbing and hiking on glaciers</i></p>
    <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the countrys namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell)</p>
